Overview
========

OpenDNP3 is a portable, scalable, and rigorously tested implementation 
of the DNP3 (www.dnp.org) protocol stack written in C++. The library 
is optimized for the largest front end processor implementations
and slave device simulations, although it performs very well on 
embedded linux ARM in a single outstation configuration.

Custom written, idiomatic bindings are available for the 
Microsoft CLR family of languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, etc) and JVM-based
languages (Java, Scala, Clojure, etc).

Building 1.1.x on Ubuntu 14.04
========================

Install libraries as required by configure script (e.g. libboost-all-dev)

autoreconf -i -f
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 ./configure --enable-java --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
make -j6
cd java
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(readlink -f ../.libs) JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 mvn clean install
